This project was version three of a line of craps applications I developed throughout my college career. The first being a craps calculator that graphed strategies. The second being a single player craps game with 3D dice; and the final being a multiplayer game designed for use with a 42â€³ touchscreen.

It was developed using Flash AS3. The user experience was designed around a single touch touchscreen being used for a multiplayer game.
