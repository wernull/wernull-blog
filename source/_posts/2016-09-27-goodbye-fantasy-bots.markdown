After two years I decided to shutter the Fantasy Bots project. Thank you to all my beta testers who provided feedback along this journey. After starting a new job this spring the project was no longer a priority for me. It was humming along for a while but recently Yahoo! made some changes that prevented users from logging into the site. With fantasy baseball coming to an end, I decided this was as good of time as any to pull the plug.
