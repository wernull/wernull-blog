The past few years I've been focusing most of my free time off of the computer. Before I got into programming I was repairing guitars and amplifiers so when I realized the laptop had to be closed to prevent burnout, I decided to get into building tube amplifiers. After two plus years I'm feeling proud of the things I build offline and plan to focus more attention there. This blog will soon evolve away from tech.
