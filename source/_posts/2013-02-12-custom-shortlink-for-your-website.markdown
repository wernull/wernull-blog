It’s like a vanity license plate for your website. Normally I glance over short-links without thinking nothing of them, but I came across a tweet by [@destroytoday](https://twitter.com/destroytoday) with the url [dstry.it](http://dstry.it/) and BOOM the brand was burned into my head. Although having a bad ass business name helps too. I also like that a personalized short-link gives the user a bit of confidence it’s safe to click.
The hardest part to setting up a custom link system is registering a relevant domain. Two characters is almost impossible and not allowed by some top-level domains. If you’re lucky you can find a clever three or four character domain that bleeds into the TLD so it’s easy to remember and recognize.

The easiest part is setting up the domain with [bitly](http://bit.ly/). While there are some free products like [yourls](http://yourls.org/) that allow you to host your own service, they take a little more work to setup.

Finally, if you use WordPress there a lot of nice plugins to make the process even easier. My personal favorite is [bit.ly shortlink](http://yoast.com/wordpress/bitly-shortlinks/) by [Yoast](http://yoast.com/).
