For as long as I can remember I was into music and electronics. I spend almost a decade working at a music store where I learned how to repair guitars and amplifiers. After college I started a career in software engineering and put the music thing aside for a while. In 2016 I realized I needed a hobby that didn't involve coding side projects late into the night. That is when I fell back into my old love of guitars and amplifiers. After diving deep into vacuum tube amplifiers and learning how to build them from scratch, I enjoy coming up with unique designs that are inspired by classic tube amps. Most of the time I find a few parts to make the corner stone of the design and adapt everything around them. In the end they are typically more like functional art than clones of classic amps.
