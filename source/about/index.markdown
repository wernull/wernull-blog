For as long as I can remember I was into music and electronics. I spent almost a decade working at a music store where I learned how to repair guitars and amplifiers. After college I started a career in software engineering and put the music thing aside for a while. In 2016 I realized I needed a hobby that didn't involve coding side projects late into the night. That is when I fell back into my old love of guitars and amplifiers. I have been diving deep into vacuum tube amplifiers and learning how to build them from scratch. My designs are unique but inspired by classic tube amps. Most of the time I find a few antique parts to make the corner stone of the design and adapt everything around them. I'm still trying to find my niche but in the meantime it's fun to experiment with different ideas.
