I’m a Developer.

Why do I prefer this single word over many of the labels flying around these days? Because the current state of our industry requires constant adaptation. In the past I could have been labeled a Flash Developer, today I might be called a Web Developer and tomorrow… only time will tell. The people who matter will know exactly what I do from this one word and those who don’t will think I’m in real estate.
